# RISC-V
RISC-V Processor Verilog Design Code is a hardware description language (HDL) implementation of a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture, specifically the RISC-V ISA. This code defines the structural and behavioral components of the processor, including the datapath, control unit, and memory interface.
